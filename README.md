# About The Project
This repository contains the datasets and output files for our experiments on generating triplets of Legal Documents using various Large Language Models (LLMs). The project involves testing the pipeline on different datasets and LLMs to evaluate their performance and efficiency.

## Datasets
- **REBEL Dataset**: Provided in the repository.
- **Legal Judgement Dataset**: Tokenized judgement titled “Indian Oil Corporation v NEPC India Limited and Others - Supreme Court of India”.
- **10 Judgement Summaries**: Contains summaries of 10 different Indian Judgment Datasets

### Output Files
Output files include:
- **Triplets**: Generated triplets for each dataset.
- **Combined Files**: Original Sentences along with Generated Triplets, helpful for Analysis .
