100. A commercial transaction or a contractual dispute, apart from furnishing a cause of action for seeking remedy in civil law, may also involve a criminal offence.
[['commercial transaction', 'may involve', 'criminal offence'], ['contractual dispute', 'may involve', 'criminal offence']]

101. As the nature and scope of a civil proceedings are different from a criminal proceeding, the mere fact that the complaint relates to a commercial transaction or breach of contract, for which a civil remedy is available or has been availed, is not by itself a ground to quash the criminal proceedings.
[['civil proceedings', 'type of proceeding', 'criminal proceeding'], ['civil remedy', 'available for', 'commercial transaction'], ['civil remedy', 'available for', 'breach of contract'], ['criminal proceeding', 'type of proceeding', 'civil proceeding']]

[['business circles', 'tendency', 'convert purely civil disputes into criminal cases'], ['business circles', 'location', 'this issue']]

105. This is obviously on account of a prevalent impression that civil law remedies are time consuming and do not adequately protect the interests of lenders/creditors.

109. Any effort to settle civil disputes and claims, which do not involve any criminal offence, by applying pressure though criminal prosecution should be deprecated and discouraged.

120. While no one with a legitimate cause or grievance should be prevented from seeking remedies available in criminal law, a complainant who initiates or persists with a prosecution, being fully aware that the criminal proceedings are unwarranted and his remedy lies only in civil law, should himself be made accountable, at the end of such misconceived criminal proceedings, in accordance with law.One positive step that can be taken by the courts, to curb unnecessary prosecutions and harassment of innocent parties, is to exercise their power u/s.

[['IOC', 'initiated', 'civil proceedings'], ['civil proceedings', 'purpose', 'safeguard its interests'], ['civil proceedings', 'purpose', 'recover the amounts due']]

125. It has filed CS No.425/1997 in the Madras High Court and OS No.3327/1998 in the City Civil Court, Chennai seeking injunctive reliefs to restrain the NEPC India from removing its aircrafts so that it can exercise its right to possess the Aircrafts.

[['IOC', 'initiated proceedings for winding up', 'NEPC India'], ['IOC', 'filed a petition seeking initiation of proceedings for contempt', 'NEPC India']]

129. These acts show that civil remedies were and are available in law and IOC has taken recourse to such remedies.

136. But these are defences that will have to be put forth and considered during the trial.

139. At this stage, we are only concerned with the question whether the averments in the complaint spell out the ingredients of a criminal offence or not.

144. This takes us to the question whether the allegations made in the complaint, when taken on their face value as true and correct, constitute offences defined under sections 378, 403, 405, 415 and 425 IPCLearned counsel for the appellant restricted his submissions only to sections 405, 415 and 425, thereby fairly conceding that the averments in the complaint do not contain the averments necessary to make out the ingredients of the offence of theft (s 378) or dishonest misappropriation of property (s. 403).

147. S. 378 defines theft.
[['S. 378', 'defines', 'theft']]

150. The averments in the complaint clearly show that neither the aircrafts nor their engines were ever in the possession of IOC.
[['IOC', 'possesses', 'aircrafts'], ['IOC', 'possesses', 'engines']]

151. It is admitted that they were in the possession of NEPC India at all relevant times.
[['NEPC India', 'possesses', 'they']]

152. The question of NEPC committing theft of something in its own possession does not arise.

158. The basic requirement for attracting the section are:
[]

159. "(i) the movable property in question should belong to a person other than the accused;
[]

160. (ii) the accused should wrongly appropriate or convert such property to his own use; and
[['such property', 'belong to', 'the accused']]

163. Here again the basic requirement is that the subject matter of dishonest misappropriation or conversion should be someone else's movable property.
[['dishonest misappropriation or conversion', 'subject matter', "someone else's movable property"]]

[['property', 'has dominion or power over', 'accused'], ['accused', 'was entrusted with', 'property']]

194. It has to be established further that in respect of the property so entrusted, there was dishonest misappropriation or dishonest conversion or dishonest use or disposal in violation of a direction of law or legal contract, by the accused himself or by someone else which he willingly suffered to do.

195.

204. The question is whether there is 'entrustment' in an hypothecation?

205. Hypothecation is a mode of creating a security without delivery of title or possession.

206. Both ownership of the movable property and possession thereof, remain with the debtor.
[['debtor', 'owns', 'movable property'], ['debtor', 'possesses', 'movable property']]

207. The creditor has an equitable charge over the property and is given a right to take possession and sell the hypothecated movables to recover his dues (note : we are not expressing any opinion on the question whether possession can be taken by the creditor, without or with recourse to a court of law).

210. The following definitions of the term 'hypothecation' in P Ramanatha Aiyar's Advanced Law Lexicon (Third (2005) Edition, Vol.2, Pages 2179 and 2180) are relevant:
[]

211. "Hypothecation: It is the act of pledging an asset as security for borrowing, without parting with its possession or ownership.

[['borrower', 'enters into agreement with', 'lender'], ['borrower', 'hands over possession of', 'hypothecated asset'], ['lender', 'calls upon', 'borrower']]

213. The charge of hypothecation is then converted into that of a pledge and the lender enjoys the rights of a pledgee."
[['hypothecation', 'converted into', 'pledge'], ['lender', 'enjoys the rights of', 'pledgee']]

214. 41.
[]

215. 'Hypothecation' means a charge in or upon any movable property, existing in future, created by a borrower in favour of a secured creditor, without delivery of possession of the movable property to such creditor, as a security for financial assistance and includes floating charge and crystallization of such charge into fixed charge on movable property.

[]

218. But there is no 'entrustment of the property' or 'entrustment of dominion over the property' by the hypothecatee (creditor) to the hypothecator (debtor) in an hypothecation.

219. When possession has remained with the debtor/owner and when the creditor has neither ownership nor beneficial interest, obviously there cannot be any entrustment by the creditor.

221. The question directly arose for consideration in Central Bureau of Investigation v. Duncans Agro Industries Ltd, Calcutta [1996 (5) SCC 591].

222. 1996 Indlaw SC 2982 It related to a complaint against the accused for offences of criminal breach of trust.
[['1996 Indlaw SC 2982', 'related to', 'complaint'], ['complaint', 'against', 'accused'], ['accused', 'charged with', 'offences of criminal breach of trust']]

223. It was alleged that a floating charge was created by the accused debtor on the goods by way of security under a deed of hypothecation, in favour of a bank to cover credit facility and that the said goods were disposed of by the debtor.
[]

224. 44.
[]

225. It was contended that the disposal of the goods amounted to criminal breach of trust.
[['goods', 'disposed of', 'trust'], ['trust', 'breached', 'crime'], ['crime', 'type of', 'breach of trust']]

226. Negativing the said contention, this Court after stating the principle as to when a complaint can be quashed at the threshold, held thus:
[]

227. " .a serious dispute has been raised by the learned counsel as to whether on the face of the allegations, an offence of criminal breach of trust is constituted or not.
[]

228. In our view, the expression 'entrusted with property' or 'with any dominion over property' has been used in a wide sense in Section 405, I.PC Such expression includes all cases in which goods are entrusted, that is, voluntarily handed over for a specific purpose and dishonestly disposed of in violation of law or in violation of contract.
[['Section 405, I.PC', 'contains expression', 'entrusted with property'], ['Section 405, I.PC', 'contains expression', 'with any dominion over property'], ['entrusted with property', 'includes', 'all cases'], ['all cases', 'characterized by', 'goods are entrusted'], ['goods are entrusted', 'characterized by', 'voluntarily handed over for a specific purpose'], ['goods are entrusted', 'characterized by', 'dishonestly disposed of in violation of law'], ['goods are entrusted', 'characterized by', 'dishonestly disposed of in violation of contract']]

229. The expression 'entrusted' appearing in Section 405, I.PC is not necessarily a term of law.
[['Section 405, I.PC', 'contains term', 'entrusted'], ['entrusted', 'term of', 'law']]

230. It has wide and different implications in different contexts.
[]

231. It is, however, necessary that the ownership or beneficial interest in the ownership of the property entrusted in respect of which offence is alleged to have been committed must be in some person other than the accused and the latter must hold it on account of some person or in some way for his benefit.
[['property', 'entrusted to', 'some person'], ['some person', 'owns', 'property'], ['some person', 'beneficial interest in', 'property'], ['property', 'held by', 'accused'], ['accused', 'holds on account of', 'some person']]

232. The expression 'trust' in Section 405, I.PC is a comprehensive expression and has been used to denote various kinds of relationship like the relationship of trustee and beneficiary, bailor and bailee, master and servant, pledger and pledgee.
[['trust', 'denote relationship of', 'trustee and beneficiary'], ['trust', 'denote relationship of', 'bailor and bailee'], ['trust', 'denote relationship of', 'master and servant'], ['trust', 'denote relationship of', 'pledger and pledgee']]

233. When some goods are hypothecated by a person to another person, the ownership of the goods still remains with the person who has hypothecated such goods.
[['goods', 'hypothecated by', 'person'], ['person', 'owns', 'goods'], ['person', 'hypothecates', 'goods']]

234. The property in respect of which criminal breach of trust can be committed must necessarily be the property of some person other than the accused or the beneficial interest in or ownership of it must be in other person and the offender must hold such property in trust for such other person or for his benefit.
[['property', 'can be the subject of', 'criminal breach of trust'], ['property', 'belong to', 'person'], ['property', 'belong to', 'accused'], ['property', 'belong to', 'other person'], ['beneficial interest', 'belong to', 'other person'], ['property', 'held in trust for', 'other person'], ['property', 'held in trust for', 'person'], ['offender', 'hold', 'property'], ['offender', 'hold in trust', 'property']]

235. In a case of pledge, the pledged article belongs to some other person but the same is kept in trust by the pledgee.
[['pledged article', 'belongs to', 'some other person'], ['pledged article', 'kept in trust by', 'pledgee']]

236. In the instant case, a floating charge was made on the goods by way of security to cover up credit facility.
[['floating charge', 'type of security', 'credit facility']]

237. In our view, in such case for disposing of the goods covering the security against credit facility, the offence of criminal breach of trust is not committed."
[]

238. (emphasis supplied)

239. 45.
[]

240. The allegations in the complaints are that aircrafts and the engines fitted therein belong to NEPC India, and that a charge was created thereon by NEPC India, in favour of IOC, by way of hypothecation to secure repayment of the amounts due to IOC.
[['aircrafts', 'belong to', 'NEPC India'], ['NEPC India', 'owns', 'aircrafts'], ['NEPC India', 'owns', 'engines']]

241. The terms of hypothecation extracted in the complaint show that the ownership and possession of the aircrafts continued with NEPC India.
[['NEPC India', 'owns', 'aircrafts'], ['NEPC India', 'possesses', 'aircrafts']]

242. Possession of the aircraft, neither actual nor symbolic, was delivered to IOC.
[['IOC', 'received possession of', 'aircraft']]

243. NEPC India was entitled to use the aircraft and maintain it in good state of repairs.
[['NEPC India', 'entitled to use', 'aircraft'], ['NEPC India', 'maintain', 'aircraft']]

244. 46.
[]

245. IOC was given the right to take possession of the hypothecated aircrafts only in the event of any default as mentioned in the Hypothecation Deed.
[['IOC', 'given the right to take possession of', 'hypothecated aircrafts'], ['Hypothecation Deed', 'mentions', 'default'], ['IOC', 'given the right to take possession of', 'Hypothecation Deed']]

246. It is not the case of the IOC that it took possession of the aircraft in exercise of the right vested in it under the Deed of Hypothecation.
[['IOC', 'took possession of', 'aircraft'], ['IOC', 'exercise of right vested in', 'Deed of Hypothecation'], ['Deed of Hypothecation', 'granted right to', 'IOC']]

247. Thus, as the possession of the aircraft remained all along with NEPC India in its capacity as the owner and the Deed of Hypothecation merely created a charge over the aircrafts with a right to take possession in the event of default, it cannot be said that there was either entrustment of the aircrafts or entrustment of the dominion over the aircrafts by IOC to NEPC India.
[['NEPC India', 'capacity', 'owner'], ['NEPC India', 'possesses', 'aircraft'], ['NEPC India', 'created charge over', 'aircraft'], ['Deed of Hypothecation', 'created charge over', 'aircraft'], ['NEPC India', 'has right to take possession', 'aircraft'], ['IOC', 'entrustment of dominion over', 'aircraft']]

248. The very first requirement of section 405, that is the person accused of criminal breach of trust must have been "entrusted with the property" or "entrusted with any dominion over property" is, therefore, absent.
[['person accused of criminal breach of trust', 'must have been entrusted with', 'property'], ['property', 'entrusted with', 'person accused of criminal breach of trust'], ['property', 'type of', 'dominion over property']]

249. 47.
[]

250. Learned counsel for the appellant, however, sought to distinguish the decision in Duncan Agro 1996 Indlaw SC 2982 on two grounds.
[['Duncan Agro', 'decision in', '1996 Indlaw SC 2982'], ['1996 Indlaw SC 2982', 'cited by', 'appellant'], ['appellant', 'used decision', 'Duncan Agro']]

251. It was pointed out that Duncan Agro 1996 Indlaw SC 2982 itself recognizes that there can be criminal breach of trust where a beneficial interest exists in the other person, and the offender holds the property in trust for such person.
[['Duncan Agro', 'recognizes', 'criminal breach of trust'], ['criminal breach of trust', 'occurs when', 'beneficial interest exists'], ['beneficial interest exists', 'in the other person', 'Duncan Agro']]

252. It is submitted that when the deed of hypothecation was executed by NEPC India in favour of IOC, the hypothecation created a beneficial interest in the property in favour of IOC, and vis-'-vis such 'beneficial interest' of IOC, the possession of the property by NEPC India was in 'trust'.
[['NEPC India', 'executed deed of hypothecation in favour of', 'IOC'], ['IOC', 'beneficial interest in', 'property'], ['NEPC India', 'trustee of', 'property'], ['property', 'owned by', 'NEPC India'], ['IOC', 'beneficial interest in', 'property']]

253. In support of this contention, reliance was placed on a decision of the Sind Judicial Commissioner in Gobindram C Motwani v. Emperor : (1938) 39 Cr.LJ 509.
[['Sind Judicial Commissioner', 'issued decision in', 'Gobindram C Motwani v. Emperor'], ['Gobindram C Motwani v. Emperor', 'decided by', 'Sind Judicial Commissioner'], ['Gobindram C Motwani v. Emperor', 'year of decision', '1938'], ['Gobindram C Motwani v. Emperor', 'case number', '(1938) 39 Cr.LJ 509']]

254. In that case the complaint was that the accused had hypothecated the goods in their shop as collateral security against an advance and had agreed to hold the goods and proceeds thereof in trust and to pay the proceeds as and when received by them.
[['the accused', 'had hypothecated the goods in their shop as collateral security against an advance', 'an advance'], ['the accused', 'held the goods and proceeds thereof in trust', 'the goods and proceeds thereof'], ['the accused', 'held the goods and proceeds thereof in trust', 'the proceeds thereof'], ['the accused', 'agreed to pay the proceeds as and when received by them', 'the proceeds thereof']]

255. 48.
[]

256. However, as they did not pay the proceeds, the complaint was that they committed criminal breach of trust.
[]

257. The Magistrate took the view that as the hypothecated goods were still the property of the accused, they could not commit criminal breach of trust in respect of their own property.
[['Magistrate', 'took view', 'hypothecated goods'], ['hypothecated goods', 'property of', 'accused'], ['accused', 'property of', 'hypothecated goods'], ['hypothecated goods', 'could not commit criminal breach of trust', 'Magistrate'], ['accused', 'could not commit criminal breach of trust', 'Magistrate']]

258. The Judicial Commissioner did not agree.
[['Judicial Commissioner', 'opinion', 'did not agree']]

259. He held:
[]

260. "The test in this case appears to me to be whether the owner of the goods, the accused, created an equitable charge over the goods in their possession when they executed the trust receipt.
[['owner of the goods', 'is', 'accused'], ['accused', 'created', 'equitable charge over the goods'], ['accused', 'possesses', 'goods'], ['accused', 'executed', 'trust receipt']]

261. If they did so, they held the goods as trustees, they were "in some manner entrusted" with the goods, and if they dealt with them in violation of the terms of the trust, they committed an offence under this section, provided they had the necessary criminal intent.
[['goods', 'held as', 'trustees'], ['goods', 'entrusted to', 'them'], ['them', 'dealt with', 'goods'], ['them', 'committed an offence under', 'this section'], ['this section', 'requires', 'criminal intent']]

262. I can myself see no reason why it should be said that by this trust receipt the accused did not give a beneficial interest in the goods to the applicant and did not hold the goods, with which they were entrusted as legal owners in trust for the applicant.
[['accused', 'did not give beneficial interest in', 'applicant'], ['accused', 'did not hold', 'goods'], ['accused', 'held goods in trust for', 'applicant']]

263. That being so, I think the learned Magistrate was wrong in his decision that the accused could not be guilty of criminal breach of trust because the goods were their own property."
[['Magistrate', 'made decision', 'the accused could not be guilty of criminal breach of trust'], ['the accused could not be guilty of criminal breach of trust', 'based on', 'the goods were their own property']]

264. 49.
[]

265. It is evident that the said observations were made on the peculiar facts of that case where the Commissioner concluded that the goods were held by the accused in trust as trustee in view of execution of a 'Trust Receipt' by the accused.
[['Trust Receipt', 'type of document', 'Trust'], ['Trust Receipt', 'created by', 'accused'], ['accused', 'held goods in trust', 'goods'], ['accused', 'role', 'trustee']]

266. 50.
[]

267. The facts were somewhat similar to example (viii) in Para 17 above.
[['example', 'mentioned in', 'Para 17'], ['Para 17', 'contains example', 'example'], ['example', 'similar to', 'facts']]

268. Further the Judicial Commissioner finally observed that there was so much room for an honest difference of opinion as to the rights and liabilities of the parties to the trust receipt that no useful purpose could be served in interfering with the order of discharge by the Magistrate.
[['Judicial Commissioner', 'made observation', 'there was so much room for an honest difference of opinion'], ['there was so much room for an honest difference of opinion', 'concerned', 'rights and liabilities of the parties to the trust receipt'], ['rights and liabilities of the parties to the trust receipt', 'concerned', 'trust receipt'], ['trust receipt', 'type of', 'document'], ['trust receipt', 'issued by', 'Magistrate'], ['Magistrate', 'issued order of discharge', 'order of discharge'], ['order of discharge', 'concerned', 'parties to the trust receipt']]

269. The said decision is therefore of no assistance to the appellant.
[['The said decision', 'is of no assistance to', 'the appellant']]

270. 51.
[]

271. If the observations relied on by the appellant are to be interpreted as holding that the debtor holds the hypothecated goods, in trust for the creditor, then they are contrary to the decision of this Court in Duncan Agro 1996 Indlaw SC 2982 (supra) which specifically holds that when goods are hypothecated, the owner does not hold the goods in trust for the creditor.
[['Duncan Agro', 'case number', '1996 Indlaw SC 2982'], ['Duncan Agro', 'decision', 'owner does not hold the goods in trust for the creditor'], ['Duncan Agro', 'cited by', 'this Court'], ['this Court', 'decision', 'owner does not hold the goods in trust for the creditor']]

272. 52.
[]

273. A charge over the hypothecated goods in favour of the creditor, cannot be said to create a beneficial interest in the creditor, until and unless the creditor in exercise of his rights under the deed, takes possession.
[['hypothecated goods', 'subject of charge', 'creditor'], ['creditor', 'takes possession of', 'hypothecated goods'], ['creditor', 'beneficial interest in', 'hypothecated goods']]

274. 53.
[]

275. The term 'beneficial interest' has a specific meaning and connotation.
[['beneficial interest', 'has meaning', 'specific'], ['beneficial interest', 'has connotation', 'specific']]

276. When a trust is created vesting a property in the trustee, the right of the beneficiary against the trustee (who is the owner of the trust property) is known as the 'beneficial interest'.
[['trust', 'creates', 'beneficial interest'], ['beneficial interest', 'held by', 'beneficiary'], ['trustee', 'owns', 'trust property'], ['trust property', 'held by', 'trustee']]

277. The trustee has the power of management and the beneficiary has the right of enjoyment.
[['trustee', 'has power of', 'management'], ['beneficiary', 'has right of', 'enjoyment']]

278. Whenever there is a breach of any duty imposed on the trustee with reference to the trust property or the beneficiary, he commits a breach of trust.
[['trustee', 'breaches duty', 'trust'], ['trustee', 'manages', 'trust property'], ['trustee', 'benefits', 'beneficiary']]

279. 54.
[]

280. On the other hand, when the owner of a goods hypothecates a movable property in favour of a creditor, no 'beneficial interest' is created in favour of the creditor nor does the owner become a trustee in regard to the property hypothecated.
[['goods', 'hypothecated by', 'owner'], ['owner', 'grants beneficial interest', 'creditor'], ['creditor', 'grants beneficial interest', 'none'], ['owner', 'becomes trustee', 'none']]

281. The right of the creditor under a deed of hypothecation is the right to enforce the charge created under the deed of hypothecation in the manner specified in the deed and by no stretch of imagination can such right be equated to a beneficial interest of a beneficiary in a property held in trust.
[['deed of hypothecation', 'creates charge', 'deed of hypothecation'], ['deed of hypothecation', 'specifies manner of enforcement', 'deed of hypothecation'], ['deed of hypothecation', 'grants right to creditor', 'creditor'], ['creditor', 'has right', 'deed of hypothecation'], ['beneficiary', 'has beneficial interest', 'property'], ['property', 'held in trust', 'beneficiary']]

282. Therefore, the first contention that a creditor has a beneficial interest in the hypothecated property and the owner is in the position of a trustee with reference to the creditor is liable to be rejected.
[]

283. 55.
[]

284. The second ground on which learned counsel for the appellant sought to distinguish Duncan Agro 1996 Indlaw SC 2982 is that the said case dealt with a hypothecation deed creating a floating charge, whereas the case on hand related to a fixed charge and therefore, the principle laid down in Duncan Agro 1996 Indlaw SC 2982 will not apply.
[['Duncan Agro 1996 Indlaw SC 2982', 'dealt with', 'hypothecation deed'], ['Duncan Agro 1996 Indlaw SC 2982', 'laid down principle', 'principle'], ['Duncan Agro 1996 Indlaw SC 2982', 'case', 'appellant'], ['case on hand', 'related to', 'fixed charge'], ['fixed charge', 'subclass of', 'charge'], ['hypothecation deed', 'subclass of', 'deed']]

285. 56.
[]

286. This contention is also without basis.
[]

287. The principle stated in Duncan Agro 1996 Indlaw SC 2982 will apply in regard to all types of hypothecations.
[['Duncan Agro', 'year of decision', '1996'], ['Duncan Agro', 'case number', 'Indlaw SC 2982'], ['Duncan Agro', 'stated principle applies to', 'all types of hypothecations']]

288. It makes no difference whether the charge created by the deed of hypothecation is a floating charge or a fixed charge.
[['deed of hypothecation', 'creates charge', 'floating charge'], ['floating charge', 'subclass of', 'charge'], ['floating charge', 'subclass of', 'charge'], ['deed of hypothecation', 'creates charge', 'fixed charge'], ['fixed charge', 'subclass of', 'charge']]

289. Where a specific existing property is hypothecated what is created is a 'fixed' charge.
[['specific existing property', 'hypothecated', 'fixed charge']]

290. The floating charge refers to a charge created generally against the assets held by the debtor at any given point of time during the subsistence of the deed of hypothecation.
[['floating charge', 'type of', 'charge'], ['charge', 'created by', 'deed of hypothecation'], ['deed of hypothecation', 'creates', 'charge'], ['deed of hypothecation', 'relates to', 'debtor'], ['debtor', 'holds', 'assets']]

291. For example where a borrower hypothecates his stock-in-trade in favour of the Bank creating a floating charge, the stock-in-trade, held by the borrower as on the date of hypothecation may be sold or disposed of by the debtor without reference to the creditor.
[['stock-in-trade', 'hypothecated by', 'borrower'], ['borrower', 'has', 'stock-in-trade'], ['borrower', 'creates floating charge in favour of', 'Bank'], ['Bank', 'has floating charge on', 'stock-in-trade']]

292. 57.
[]

293. But as and when new stock-in-trade is manufactured or received, the charge attaches to such future stock- in-trade until it is disposed of.
[['charge', 'attaches to', 'future stock-in-trade'], ['future stock-in-trade', 'is manufactured or received', 'new stock-in-trade'], ['future stock-in-trade', 'is disposed of', 'charge']]

294. The creditor has the right at any given point of time to exercise his right by converting the hypothecation into a pledge by taking possession of the stock-in-trade held by the debtor at that point of time.
[['creditor', 'has right', 'exercise'], ['creditor', 'has right', 'convert'], ['creditor', 'takes possession of', 'stock-in-trade'], ['debtor', 'holds', 'stock-in-trade']]

295. The principle in Duncan Agro 1996 Indlaw SC 2982 is based on the requirement of 'entrustment' and not with reference to the 'floating' nature of the charge.
[['Duncan Agro', 'year of case', '1996'], ['Duncan Agro', 'case number', 'Indlaw SC 2982'], ['Duncan Agro', 'case principle based on', 'entrustment']]

296. The second contention also has no merit.
[]

297. 58.
[]

298. We accordingly hold that the basic and very first ingredient of criminal breach of trust, that is entrustment, is missing and therefore, even if all the allegations in the complaint are taken at their face value as true, no case of 'criminal breach of trust' as defined u/s.
[['criminal breach of trust', 'ingredient', 'entrustment'], ['entrustment', 'missing', 'criminal breach of trust'], ['criminal breach of trust', 'defined by', 'u/s']]

299. 405 IPC can be made out against NEPC India.
[['405 IPC', 'can be made out against', 'NEPC India']]

300. Section 415
[['Section 415', 'part of', 'legal code']]

301. The essential ingredients of the offence of 'cheating' are:
[]

302. (i) deception of a person either by making a false or misleading representation or by other action or omission
[['deception of a person', 'characterized by', 'false or misleading representation'], ['deception of a person', 'characterized by', 'other action or omission']]

303. (ii) fraudulent or dishonest inducement of that person to either deliver any property or to consent to the retention thereof by any person or to intentionally induce that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property.
[['fraudulent or dishonest inducement', 'cause of damage', 'body'], ['fraudulent or dishonest inducement', 'cause of damage', 'mind'], ['fraudulent or dishonest inducement', 'cause of damage', 'reputation'], ['fraudulent or dishonest inducement', 'cause of damage', 'property']]

304. 59.
[]

305. The High Court has held that mere breach of a contractual terms would not amount to cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of the transaction and in the absence of an allegation that the accused had a fraudulent or dishonest intention while making a promise, there is no 'cheating'.
[['High Court', 'has held that', 'mere breach of a contractual terms'], ['High Court', 'would not amount to', 'cheating'], ['cheating', 'requires', 'fraudulent or dishonest intention'], ['fraudulent or dishonest intention', 'must be shown', 'at the beginning of the transaction'], ['transaction', 'requires', 'fraudulent or dishonest intention'], ['absence of', 'fraudulent or dishonest intention', 'makes cheating not exist']]

306. The High Court has relied on several decisions of this Court wherein this Court has held that dishonest intent at the time of making the promise/inducement is necessary, in addition to the subsequent failure to fulfil the promise.
[['The High Court', 'relied on', 'several decisions of this Court'], ['this Court', 'held that', 'dishonest intent at the time of making the promise/inducement is necessary'], ['this Court', 'held that', 'subsequent failure to fulfil the promise is necessary']]

307. Illustrations (f) and (g) to s. 415 makes this position clear:
[]

308. "(f) A intentionally deceives Z into a belief that A means to repay any money that Z may lend to him and thereby dishonestly induces Z to lend him money, A not intending to repay it.
[['A', 'intentionally deceives', 'Z'], ['A', 'means to repay', 'money'], ['A', 'induces', 'Z'], ['Z', 'lends', 'A'], ['A', 'not intending to repay', 'money']]

309. A cheats."

310. "(g).

312. A cheats; but if A, at the time of obtaining the money, intends to deliver the indigo plant, and afterwards breaks his contact and does not deliver it, he does not cheat, but is liable only to a civil action for breach of contract."
[['A', 'intends to deliver', 'indigo plant'], ['A', 'breaks contract', 'indigo plant'], ['A', 'liable for', 'civil action'], ['A', 'liable for', 'breach of contract']]

314. "It is not necessary that a complainant should verbatim reproduce in the body of his complaint all the ingredients of the offence he is alleging.

[['person', 'induces victim of representation', 'person'], ['person', 'induces representation', 'person'], ['person', 'intends to commit offence', 'person'], ['person', 'commits offence', 'person']]

[['he', 'may be induced fraudulently or dishonestly to deliver any property to', 'any person'], ['any person', 'recipient of', 'property'], ['property', 'type of', 'any property']]

[['acts', 'second class of', 'acts'], ['inducing', 'must be intentional', 'acts'], ['inducing', 'must not be', 'fraudulent or dishonest']]

327. In determining the question it has to be kept in mind that the distinction between mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating is a fine one.
[['distinction', 'between', 'mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating'], ['distinction', 'is a fine one', 'between mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating']]

328. It depends upon the intention of the accused at the time to inducement which may be judged by his subsequent conduct but for this subsequent conduct is not the sole test.
[['accused', 'intention', 'inducement'], ['inducement', 'judged by', 'subsequent conduct'], ['subsequent conduct', 'test', 'sole test']]

329. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of the transaction, that is the time when the offence is said to have been committed.
[['breach of contract', 'cannot give rise to', 'criminal prosecution for cheating'], ['criminal prosecution for cheating', 'requires', 'fraudulent or dishonest intention'], ['fraudulent or dishonest intention', 'must be shown at', 'the beginning of the transaction']]

330. Therefore it is the intention which is the gist of the offence.
[['intention', 'is the gist of', 'offence']]

331. To hold a person guilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise.
[['person', 'can be guilty of', 'cheating'], ['person', 'has intention', 'fraudulent or dishonest intention'], ['person', 'makes promise at', 'time of making the promise']]

332. From his mere failure to keep up promise subsequently such a culpable intention right at the beginning, that is, when he made the promise cannot be presumed."

334. In this case, the complaints clearly allege that the accused with fraudulent intention to cheat and defraud the IOC, had induced IOC to resume supply of aircraft fuel on cash and carry basis, by entering into a further agreement dated 2091997 and undertaking to clear the outstanding amount of Rs18 crores approximately within the time stipulated in the Hypothecation Agreements.

336. The sum and substance of the said allegation read with other averments extracted above, is that NEPC India, having committed default in paying the sum of Rs18 crores, entered into a fresh agreement dated 2091997 agreeing to clear the outstanding as per a fresh schedule, with the dishonest and fraudulent intention of pre-empting and avoiding any action by IOC in terms of the hypothecation deeds to take possession of the aircrafts.
[['NEPC India', 'committed default in paying', 'Rs18 crores'], ['NEPC India', 'entered into agreement', '2091997'], ['NEPC India', 'intention', 'pre-empting and avoiding any action'], ['NEPC India', 'intention', 'fraudulent'], ['NEPC India', 'intention', 'dishonest'], ['NEPC India', 'intention', 'avoiding any action'], ['NEPC India', 'intention', 'pre-empting'], ['NEPC India', 'intention', 'by IOC'], ['NEPC India', 'intention', 'in terms of the hypothecation deeds'], ['NEPC India', 'intention', 'to take possession of the aircrafts']]

337. Though the supplies after 2091997 were on cash and carry basis, the fraudulent intention is alleged to emanate from the promise under the said agreement to make payment, thereby preventing immediate seizure (taking possession) of the aircrafts by IOC.
[['supplies', 'basis', 'cash and carry'], ['agreement', 'contains promise', 'payment'], ['agreement', 'contains promise', 'make payment'], ['payment', 'prevents', 'immediate seizure'], ['immediate seizure', 'action taken by', 'IOC'], ['IOC', 'owns', 'aircrafts']]

339. This allegation made in addition to the allegation relating to removal of engines, has been lost sight of by the High Court.
[['allegation', 'made in addition to', 'allegation'], ['allegation', 'relating to', 'removal of engines'], ['High Court', 'lost sight of', 'allegation']]

340. All that is to be seen is whether the necessary allegations exist in the complaint to bring the case within s. 415.
[['s. 415', 'contains legal provision', 'case'], ['case', 'within legal provision', 's. 415'], ['complaint', 'contains allegations', 'case']]

341. We are clearly of the view that the allegations in the complaint constitute such an offence.

342. We are not concerned with the proof of such allegations or ultimate outcome of trial at this stage.

352. The complaints clearly allege that NEPC India removed the engines thereby making a change in the aircrafts and that such removal has diminished the value and utility of the aircrafts and affected them injuriously, thereby causing loss and damage to IOC, which has the right to possess the entire aircraft.
[['NEPC India', 'removed', 'engines'], ['NEPC India', 'made change in', 'aircrafts'], ['aircrafts', 'owned by', 'IOC'], ['IOC', 'has right to possess', 'aircrafts'], ['aircrafts', 'value and utility diminished', 'NEPC India'], ['NEPC India', 'caused loss and damage to', 'IOC']]
